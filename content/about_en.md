I'm a big fan of **R** & **docker** working on data-related tasks.

I'm interested in research about **text**.

I have only recently decided to study **go language** and **vue.js**.

I am more interested in people being able to handle data more easily and eventually to facilitate data-based communication.

For most of my accounts, contacts and profiles, please see the links on the left sidebar.

###  activity

    1. Create a package, register it in [cran][등록] and manage it (put it in [github][repo] first).
    2. Try to [contribute][기여] to another package as much as possible.
    3. I ask and answer questions about R and data analysis related groups such as [Korean R user group][krug].
    4. I make and share R related [materials][Materials].
